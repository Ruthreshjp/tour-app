# 🧪 Booking Flow Test Instructions

## Test the Fixed Booking Functionality

### Step 1: Login with Test User
1. Go to http://localhost:5176/login
2. Use credentials:
   - **Email:** `testuser@example.com`
   - **Password:** `testpassword123`
3. Click "Login" - should redirect to homepage

### Step 2: Navigate to Hotels
1. Go to http://localhost:5176/travel-own/hotels
2. You should see a list of hotels
3. Click "Book Now" on any hotel

### Step 3: Test Booking Process
1. **Booking Modal Opens:** You should see the hotel booking form
2. **Check Console:** Open browser dev tools (F12) and check console for debug messages:
   - Should see: `🔍 HotelBooking - Current user: [user object]`
   - Should see: `🔍 HotelBooking - User token: [token string]`

3. **Fill Booking Form:**
   - Select a room type
   - Choose check-in date (today or later)
   - Choose check-out date (after check-in)
   - Set number of guests

4. **Submit Booking:**
   - Click "Submit Booking Request"
   - Button should change to "Processing..."
   - Console should show:
     - `🚀 Starting booking process...`
     - `📋 Booking data: [booking details]`
     - `📡 API Response: [response]`
     - `✅ Booking process completed`

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Button changes from "Submit Booking Request" → "Processing..." → Success
- ✅ Toast message: "Booking request submitted successfully!"
- ✅ UPI Payment modal opens
- ✅ No 401 authentication errors in console

### If Issues Occur:
1. **Button doesn't change:** Check console for error messages
2. **401 Error:** User not properly authenticated - try logging out and back in
3. **Firebase 404s:** These are fixed - should show placeholders instead
4. **No response:** Check if backend is running on port 8000

### Debug Information:
The booking component now shows detailed console logs to help identify issues:
- User authentication status
- Booking data being sent
- API responses
- Error details

### Quick Fix Commands:
```bash
# If backend not running:
cd e:\tour-app\backend
npm start

# If frontend not running:
cd e:\tour-app\client  
npm run dev
```
